# Traditional Setup vs. Pairing vs. Mobbing - An Experiment for Testers and Developers

# Abstract

Having worked in software for over a decade I have come into contact with many ways of coding and testing. Together with a colleague I have given sessions on how pairing can improve productivity - and in many situations I believe it can indeed do that. But should testers and developers pair on things or should they be separated by the proverbial fence? What about working in large groups?

Where is the data?

This is where you come in. Be part of something revolutionary while learning new techniques and ways of working. 

In this workshop you will experience to work in 3 configurations: as a lone tester/developer, in pairs and in mobs. You will test, fix bugs and enhance a web application. 

Together we will compare your experiences and will try to draw conclusions about which configuration works best in which situation.

# Key takeaways:

- Learn the basics of pairing
- Learn the basics of mob programming/mob testing
- Learn how to use Chrome Dev Tools to inspect the code and make code changes
- How can we find bugs earlier than in the traditional/evil testing phase?
- How can we collaborate in order to bridge the gap between developers and testers?
- Learn which way of working might be suitable for what kind of task


# Workshop length:

Full-day workshop

# Requirements

Attendees should bring a laptop with the Chrome browser.

It’s not necessarily needed to have developers participating. Everybody with some experience in web development or automation can act as a developer during the workshop.

Pairing:
Tester and developer work on the same machine with access to the code.
Display + external keyboard/mouse for each pair would be great.

Mobbing:
A group of people will work on one machine, testing and fixing bugs.
A big screen or projector + additional room would be great.
